# RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

I made this project named Rate-a-Touille as a part of **10 Days of Code** organised by **NIT Durgapur** . It is a Restaurant Management System built using **Java Swing** for the frontend and **MySQL** for the backend.
Desktop applications are losing their charm, but this is one project that has taught me a lot.

The application allows one to login with their credentials. Appropriate messages will be displayed in case of wrong password or username.

The items can be selected from the menu chart and the add button will append that item with the current order. The orders are arranged in the "order" section on the basis of their priority. The priority depends on the time of the order placed(earlier the order, greater the priority), total time it takes to prepare the order as well as on the price(no restaurant would want to lose big,fat orders). The order summary of each order will be displayed by selecting the order and clicking 'show details':
