# RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

I made this project named Rate-a-Touille as a part of **10 Days of Code** organised by **NIT Durgapur** . It is a Restaurant Management System built using **Java Swing** for the frontend and **MySQL** for the backend.
Desktop applications are losing their charm, but this is one project that has taught me a lot.
